Design notes for the customization facility

* registering a new group

  {Custom.register group(NAME [doc:DOC] [group:GROUP] [label:LABEL])}

** NAME is a symbol identifying the group.  The recommended convention
is to use 'foo.bar.baz' for subgroup baz of subgroup baz of group foo.
** DOC is a virtual string documenting the group
** GROUP is either a symbol or a list of symbols denoting all the
parent groups for this group
** LABEL is a virtual string to use for displaying the group name.
if it is omitted, NAME is used instead.

* registering a new option

  {Custom.register option(NAME [doc:DOC] [group:GROUP] [label:LABEL]
                               [type:TYPE]
                               [default:DEFAULT]
                               [set:SET]
                               [init:INIT])}

** TYPE is the type of the option and determines which option editor
widget to invoke for modifying this option
** DEFAULT is the default value
** SET is a procedure to be called whenever the option is changed
it is called with 2 args: the option name and new value
*** if the option corresponds to a property, SET would set it
** INIT is similar to SET, but is called on the initial value
maybe delay, maybe do additional work

* looking up the value of an option

  {Custom.get +NAME ?VALUE}

* exclusive access to custom module

some operations may need exclusive access to the custom module.

  lock Custom.lock then ... end

* options are initialized from the user's custom database
whose pathname is given by environment variable MOZART_CUSTOM_FILE
or defaults to ~/.oz/CUSTOM

Thus, if you want different customizations on different machines
sharing the same file system, you should set MOZART_CUSTOM_FILE
appropriately on each machine.

* when the user changes an option, he should choose whether the setting
is for the current session only or should be saved to the custom file.

For example changing an option to enable tracing should probably
not be saved.

* overriding user/default settings using environment variables or
command line options.
** --customfile=FILE
** --custom OPTION=VALUE
this option can be repeated.

To support overrides, an option declaration must declare an environment
variable that should be consulted.  It must also specify a conversion
function from string to its type.

         [env:VAR] [fromString:FUN]

* SET and INIT are not needed, instead the custom module should publish
customization events.  A module can install one or more listeners that
react to relevant events.  To facilitate filtering, each option should
be assigned to an event category: this is an arbitrary term that
listeners can match on to help them recognize relevant events.

          [category:CAT]

option(NAME [doc        : DOC]
            [group      : GROUP]
            [label      : LABEL]
            [type       : TYPE]
            [default    : DEFAULT]
            [category   : CATEGORY]
            [env        : VAR]
            [fromString : FROMSTRING])

In order for a customization event to take effect, appropriate listeners
need to be installed.  We can do this either (1) by making groups objects
that must be obtained from other modules rather than just symbols, or
(2) by specifying an init procedure for a group: to be called when an
option is registered with that group (but what about nested groups?).

some settings have to take effect immediately, e.g. setting properties
that affect the behaviour of the emulator.

However, graphical settings should not causes Tk to get loaded.
Or settings for the browser, should not cause it to get loaded either.

** an optional can be given a setting before it is defined
this happens when loading the user's custom file

* options should be registered in bundles
an agent registers a collection of option defs with the custom module
and gets back a stream of customization events concerning these
options.

        {Custom.register +OPTIONS ?EVENTS}

This way, each agent has its own stream.

What if an option belonging to one bundle is also of interest to another
agent?

* one must distinguish between bundles and groups
the former manage customization events and the latter partition
customization options in a meaningful user-oriented fashion.

bundle == custom manager

an application (agent) may need options from several bundles.  Like
any other values, bundles are obtained through imports from other
modules.

It may also be interested in customization events from these bundles.
We cannot register the agent itself with the bundle because the agent
maybe short-lived or there may be thousands of such agents.  Instead,
we must opt for a event stream based architecture.

bundles however live as long as the oz process.  For them, it makes
sense to be registered with the custom module.

However, if we directly invoke an operation on a bundle, e.g. to
effect the setting of an option (1) we don't need a new thread
(2) but we may block for a long time, (3) we must agree apriori
on how to invoke the operation.  A stream-based architecture gives
us more freedom and robustness.

A customization `set' event might have the form:

        set(OPTION VALUE SYNCH)

where OPTION is the option to be set, VALUE is the new value, and
SYNCH is a variable that the bundle manager should bind to true
when the operation has successfully completed and to false or a term
describing the problem when if has failed.  Thus SYNCH can be used
to synchronize on completion.

* kinds of customization events
** for bundle managers
*** user(OPTION VALUE)
*** set(OPTION VALUE SYNCH)

* performing a merge of N streams
may be useful when interested in events from several bundles

fun {Merge Streams}
   L P={NewPort L}
   proc {Forward V} {Send P V} end
in
   {ForAll Streams proc {$ L} thread {ForAll L Forward} end end}
   L
end
